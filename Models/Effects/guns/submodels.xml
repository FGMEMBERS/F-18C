   Guns: 1X 20 mm (0.787 in) M61 Vulcan 6-barreled gatling cannon, 940 rounds
    
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M61_Vulcan 
  
    102 g = .2249 lb
    6000 per minute = 100 per second.  #won't work in FG due to FR issues
    20 mm diameter = approx .0135 EDA (effective diameter, in sq ft)
    muzzle velocity = 1030 - 1050 mps      , = 3380 fps
    Numbers below have been tweaked form this to make it actually work decently at
    500-600 MPH on the F-15.
    
    The M-61 20mm cannon below doesn't exactly implement this (if you do the rounds start piling backwards to you at about 500-600MPH).  I don't know if this 
    is how it works in reality or FG's submodels just need some work, but 
    either way I've tweaked them so that they actually shoot forward, mostly
    through 1000 MPH or so.
   
   Missiles:
   AIM-7 Sparrow
   AIM-120 AMRAAM
   AIM-9 Sidewinder

   Other:
   up to 3X 600 US gallons (2,300 L) external drop tanks for ferry flight or   
   extended range/loitering time.
   MXU-648 Cargo/Travel Pod - to carry personal belongings, and small pieces of 
   maintenance equipment.

   The F-15 can carry up to 16,000 pounds of bombs, fuel tanks, and missiles .
The underwing pylons can each accommodate a multiple ejector rack, which can carry six 500-pound bombs. The bomb racks can be installed on the underwing pylons and still the F-15 can be equipped with the normal carriage of Sidewinder missiles. 
Air-to-ground stores can also be carried on the underfuselage centerline. A typical load consists of 18 500-pound bombs, carried 6 each on underwing and centerline ejector racks.
The F-15A/B/C/D can carry and deliver laser-guided bombs such as the GBU-10E/B Paveway II or the GBU-12D/B Paveway II. However, it does not have the capability of guiding these weapons by itself, and must rely on laser designators carried by other aircraft or by personnel on the ground.

All measurements below are in English measurements (feet/pounds), per the FG wiki documentation.
